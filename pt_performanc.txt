Performance on random_scene with book_ex camera settings

Further optimization gave +7fps on sheres3 because of smaller inside_of array.

Optimized refraction tracking:
	52 fps for spheres with full tracking, 54 without, 54 with partial tracking.
	192 fps spheres3 with tracking, 125 without, 118 with partial tracking.
	146 fps grimchild with tracking, 115 without, 115 with partial tracking.

Improved precision for hit tests, 52 fps for spheres new x-sort, 144 fps grimchild

Improved node appending syntax/AABB bug fix,
	135 fps with grimchild, 70 fps spheres old x-sort, 103 with old xyz-sort
	54 fps with new x-sort, 100 with new xyz-sort. 525 fps with dragon 1 bounce

Duplicate objects bug fix, 48 fps with grimchild with and withouth mesh transform.

Mesh transform improvement attempt, 44 fps with grimchild, 67 fps spheres

Added mesh transforms, 10 with mesh transform, 66 without

BVHnode compression,  67

BVH traversal optimization, 72, 103

before Packed range into ray, 54, 51, same after

Added texture smapling longest is 52, is 48/49

Made Meshes work! longest is 54, x is 48, import_test center is 64 fps

Added Longest axis bvh sort is 54 fps vs x axis which is 47, instancing on

Mesh Displayed for spheres is 50-51 on linux, with instancing 50-51

Added instancing for spheres is 69-70 on linux, with instancing 62 also on linux

Added instancing for spheres is 57, with instancing 50

Refraction Tracking perf gain is 57 fps, with emission 54 fps

Added emission is 54 fps, with newly added emission 49 fps

added object_id as perf gain is 56-57 fps

Added triangles commit struggles with performance
	-37 fps on random scene 0 book ex camera
	- This is because adding triangles to shader added overhead

added bvh buffer is 41 fps

added buffer updating is 41 fps

Singleton commit is 42 fps

added refraction tracking commit is 44 fps
